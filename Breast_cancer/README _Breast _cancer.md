# Breast cancer classification with a simple Neural Network
Project Type: Classification | 
Algorithm: Simple Neural Network | 
Language: Python | Dataset: knn_breast_cancer.csv
Toolkits: pandas, scikit-learn seaborn, matplotlib
# 💡 Problem Statement
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases affecting women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and improved survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and prone to human error, making automated classification systems increasingly valuable.

# Dataset Overview:
- **File**: `breast_cancer.csv`
- **Features**: Includes various diagnostic measurements (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness).
- **Target**: Binary classification — `0` for benign, `1` for malignant.


# 🧠 Domain Analysis 
 Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness: Describe shape and surface characteristics of the cell nuclei.

Compactness, Concavity, Symmetry, Fractal Dimension: Capture geometric and morphological properties.

Diagnosis: B for Benign, M for Malignant

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling (Standardization)
   - Train-test split

2. **Class Imbalance Handling**
   - Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset

3. **Modeling**
   - Simple Neural Network


# 🏆 Model Performance:
 Model gives 90% accurasy.

# Building the predictive system
